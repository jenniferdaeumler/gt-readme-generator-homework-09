 I have created an application that allows users to generate a ReadMe.MD file based on responses to prompts.  This app runs on the server using Node.JS.

## Installation 
 Clone the repo, and run the files in the server.
## Usage 
  The user will run node index.js in their terminal.  They will respond to all prompts with their keyboard, and hitting enter after typing their response.  They will use the arrow keys and enter for selecting the license.  Once all the prompts are answered, a markdown file named sampleReadMe is generated in the file.
